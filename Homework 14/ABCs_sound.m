function [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L] = ABCs_sound(filename, signal)
% ABCs of Sound
%
% This is a multi-part problem.  Do each of the parts below.
%
% DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION HEADER (the first line of code)


% A/B) wavread(). Open the .wav whose name is stored in the variable
% filename. Store the amplitude values in A and store the sampling
% frequency in B.
%
% Write your code here:


% C) Find how many samples there are in the sound file read stored in parts
% A and B? Store your answer in C.
%
% Write your code here:


% D) Find the duration (or maximum time) of the sound from part A/B. Store
% this value in D.
%
% Write your code here:


% E) Find dt (delta time), the time in seconds which each sample
% represents. Store this value in E.
%
% Write your code here:


% F) Find the frequency difference between fast fourier transforms of the 
% samples of the sound from part A/B. This can be solved by using only
% vectors A and B. Store your answer in F. 
%
% Hint: Units should be 1/s = Hz.
%
% Write your code here:


% G) Find the maximum possible frequency that could be present in A. Store
% your answer in G.  Use the Nyquist theorem.
%
% Write your code here:


% H) Find the Fast Fourier Transform of the sound from part a. Store your
% answer in H. Refer to fft.pdf.
%
% Write your code here:


% I) Find an amplitude vector that when played will be the sound from part
% a in reverse. Store your answer in I.
%
% Write your code here:


% J) Find the sampling frequency that you would use with A and sound() to
% make A sound two octaves lower.  Store the result in J.
%
% Write your code here:


% K) Find the amplitude vector that you would use with B and sound() to
% make A sound an octave higher.  Use round(linspace()). Do not round the
% third input to linspace(). Store the result in K.
%
% Write your code here:


% L) A spectrogram is a visualization of the density of a sound at a given
% frequency and time. It is also known as a sonogram. 

% Plot the spectrogram of "signal" (amplitude vector), time vs frequency.
% One can place the frequency on the x-axis or y-axis by using 'xaxis' or
% 'yaxis', respectively, as the second input to spectrogram(),
% respectively. Save the figure as L.

% Script Outputs (2): plus_sol  (double) The plus solution from the 
%                                        quadratic formula
%                     minus_sol (double) The minus solution from the
%                                        quadratic equation
% Script Description:
%   Write a script called "quadratic" that uses the coefficients A, B, and
%   C of a quadratic equation in the form
%
%                              Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0
%
%   and then applies the quadratic formula to find the two solutions of the
%   equation. Name the first output from the 'plus' solution of the
%   plus-or-minus part of the equation "plus_sol", and name the second
%   output from the 'minus' solution "minus_sol".
%
% Inputs:
A = 4
B = -10
C = 4
%
% Outputs:
%   - plus_sol: 2
%   - minus_sol: 0.5

discrim = sqrt((B .^ 2) - (4 .* A .* C)) ;
plus_sol = ( -B + discrim) ./ (2 .* A) ;
minus_sol = ( -B - discrim) ./ (2 .* A) ;
